//! [`ObservationStore`] — live eventually-consistent cluster map.
//!
//! Allocation status, service backends, node health, compiled policy
//! verdicts. Every node writes its own rows; every node reads locally.
//! Production uses Corrosion (cr-sqlite + SWIM/QUIC); simulation uses
//! `SimObservationStore` with an injectable gossip-delay and partition
//! matrix.
//!
//! # Why typed rows, not `&[u8]`
//!
//! `ObservationStore` is the observation half of the §4 Intent /
//! Observation split. Intent carries `JobSpec`, `Policy`, `Certificate`,
//! and other declaration-of-what-should-be types through [`IntentStore`].
//! Observation carries rows describing *what is happening right now*.
//!
//! A shared `write(&[u8])` surface on both stores would let a reconciler
//! accidentally route a job spec into observation (or a node heartbeat
//! into intent). The [`ObservationRow`] enum closes that door at the
//! type level: a `JobSpec` (intent class) cannot be passed to
//! [`ObservationStore::write`] — the compiler rejects it with a type
//! mismatch that names both sides.
//!
//! See `docs/whitepaper.md` §4 (Intent / Observation split) and §17
//! (storage rationale).
