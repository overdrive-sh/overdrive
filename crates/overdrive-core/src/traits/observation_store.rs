//! [`ObservationStore`] — live eventually-consistent cluster map.
//!
//! Allocation status, service backends, node health, compiled policy
//! verdicts. Every node writes its own rows; every node reads locally.
//! Production uses Corrosion (cr-sqlite + SWIM/QUIC); simulation uses
//! `SimObservationStore` with an injectable gossip-delay and partition
//! matrix.
//!
//! # Why typed rows, not `&[u8]`
//!
//! `ObservationStore` is the observation half of the §4 Intent /
//! Observation split. Intent carries `JobSpec`, `Policy`, `Certificate`,
//! and other declaration-of-what-should-be types through [`IntentStore`].
//! Observation carries rows describing *what is happening right now*.
//!
//! A shared `write(&[u8])` surface on both stores would let a reconciler
//! accidentally route a job spec into observation (or a node heartbeat
//! into intent). The [`ObservationRow`] enum closes that door at the
//! type level: a `JobSpec` (intent class) cannot be passed to
//! [`ObservationStore::write`] — the compiler rejects it with a type
//! mismatch that names both sides.
//!
//! See `docs/whitepaper.md` §4 (Intent / Observation split) and §17
//! (storage rationale).

// Each per-type envelope wraps the existing row type as `V1`. Per the
// 01-01 scaffolding-step caveat (CLAUDE.md / step description), the
// legacy row types above remain in place — call-site migration lands
// in subsequent steps (01-03 for AllocStatusRow; 02-01..02-03 for the
// rest). Inner payload types are `pub(crate)` per ADR-0048 § 2
// Layer 1 (cross-crate writers cannot name the payload to construct
// it).

// SCAFFOLD: true
//
// ADR-0048 § 2 Layer 1 specifies `pub(crate)` on inner payload
// types. In practice, rustc E0446 rejects `pub(crate)` types
// referenced from a `pub` trait's `type Latest` impl — see
// `feat(rkyv-envelope)/01-01 surfacing note` in the step return
// message. Layer 1 is therefore enforced by **non-re-export from
// `overdrive_core::lib.rs`** (cross-crate writers must reach the
// type via the verbose `overdrive_core::traits::observation_store::*`
// path, which is discouraged by code review) PLUS Layer 2 (the
// `xtask::dst_lint` envelope-variant-construction scanner in
// Group 5). The structural defense is Layer 2.
