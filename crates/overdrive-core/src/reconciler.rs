//! Reconciler primitive — the §18 pure-function contract with
//! pre-hydration + `TickContext` time injection per ADR-0013 (amended
//! 2026-04-24).
//!
//! A reconciler is a pure function over `(desired, actual, view, tick)`
//! that emits a list of [`Action`]s to converge the system toward the
//! desired state. Four patterns govern how an author writes one; each
//! is load-bearing for DST replay (whitepaper §21) and ESR verification
//! (whitepaper §18 / research §1.1, §10.5).
//!
//! # The pre-hydration pattern — ADR-0013 §2, §2b
//!
//! The trait splits into two methods with distinct purity contracts:
//!
//! * [`Reconciler::hydrate`] is `async` — the ONLY place a reconciler
//!   author touches libSQL. It reads the reconciler's private memory
//!   into an author-declared [`Reconciler::View`]. Free-form SQL lives
//!   here; so does schema management (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, ALTER
//!   TABLE ADD COLUMN). No framework migrations in Phase 1.
//! * [`Reconciler::reconcile`] is sync and pure — no `.await`, no I/O,
//!   no direct store write. It operates only on its arguments. Two
//!   invocations with the same inputs MUST produce byte-identical
//!   output tuples.
//!
//! The runtime owns the `.await` on `hydrate`, the diff-and-persist of
//! the returned view, and the commit of emitted actions through Raft.
//!
//! # The time-injection pattern — ADR-0013 §2c
//!
//! [`TickContext::now`] is the only legitimate source of "now" inside
//! `reconcile`. The runtime snapshots the injected `Clock` trait once
//! per evaluation and passes the result as a pure input — the same
//! `SystemClock` in production and `SimClock` under simulation that
//! control every other non-determinism boundary (whitepaper §21).
//!
//! Reading `Instant::now()` or `SystemTime::now()` inside a `reconcile`
//! body breaks DST replay and ESR verification; dst-lint catches it at
//! PR time (see `.claude/rules/development.md` §Reconciler I/O).
//!
//! # The `AnyReconciler` enum-dispatch convention — ADR-0013 §2a
//!
//! `async fn` in traits is not dyn-compatible, and
//! [`Reconciler::View`] is an associated type — together they make
//! `Box<dyn Reconciler>` impossible. [`AnyReconciler`] is a hand-rolled
//! enum that dispatches each trait method via a match arm per variant.
//! Static dispatch, zero heap allocation on the hot path, compile-time
//! exhaustiveness across every registered reconciler kind. **Adding a
//! new first-party reconciler means adding one variant and one match
//! arm** in each of `name`, `hydrate`, and `reconcile`. Third-party
//! reconcilers land through the WASM extension path (whitepaper §18
//! "Extension Model") and do not go through `AnyReconciler`.
//!
//! # The `NextView` return convention — ADR-0013 §2b
//!
//! Reconcilers express writes as **data**, not side effects. The
//! [`Reconciler::reconcile`] signature returns `(Vec<Action>,
//! Self::View)`; the second element is the *next* view. The runtime
//! diffs it against the hydrated view and persists the delta back to
//! libSQL. Reconcilers never write libSQL directly — the
//! `&LibsqlHandle` is not passed to `reconcile` at all. Phase 1
//! convention is full-View replacement (`NextView = Self::View`); a
//! typed-diff shape is an additive future extension.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! A minimal Phase 2+ author walkthrough, modeled on the Phase 1
//! [`NoopHeartbeat`] shape. Returns one [`Action::Noop`] and an
//! unchanged `()` next-view. The `view` and `tick` parameters are
//! referenced explicitly to demonstrate how a real reconciler would
//! consume them.
//!
//! ```
