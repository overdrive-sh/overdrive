//! Overdrive worker subsystem — `ExecDriver`, workload-cgroup
//! management, and the boot-time `node_health` row writer.
//!
//! Per ADR-0029, the worker subsystem is its own crate (class
//! `adapter-host`) so that the boundary between the control-plane and
//! the worker is enforced at compile time. The control-plane crate
//! sees only the `Driver` trait surface (from `overdrive-core`); the
//! impl is plugged in by the binary at `AppState` construction time.
//!
// `forbid(unsafe_code)` is intentionally NOT set: `Driver::stop` on
// Linux invokes `libc::kill(pid, SIGTERM)`, which requires `unsafe`.
// Per `.claude/rules/development.md`, the worker crate is class
// `adapter-host` — host-OS interaction is its raison d'être. The
// workspace-wide `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn = deny` lint still requires
// every `unsafe { ... }` block to be explicit, with a `// SAFETY:`
// comment documenting the precondition.
