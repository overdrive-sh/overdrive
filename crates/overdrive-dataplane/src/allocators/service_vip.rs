//! `ServiceVip` newtype and `ServiceVipAllocator` — concrete monotonic
//! allocator for IPv4 service VIPs.
//!
//! Per ADR-0049 § 1: the allocator is purely in-memory, synchronous, no
//! I/O, no DB handle. State at construction: a validated [`VipRange`]
//! plus a `u64` monotonic counter at zero. The persistence wrapper
//! `IntentBackedAllocator` (step 01-03) wraps this with redb-backed
//! write-through and bulk-load reconstruction.
//!
//! **Shape mirrors [`super::BackendIdAllocator`] deliberately**: memo +
//! monotonic counter, memo-hit-returns-existing, no slot reclamation on
//! release. Released entries clear the memo but the counter does not
//! rewind — a released VIP is permanently lost to the pool. This keeps
//! the allocator trivially DST-replayable and removes a class of "did
//! we reuse the right slot?" reasoning. The trade-off is operator-
//! visible: a pool sized for `N` distinct workload lifetimes; once N
//! allocations have happened (across the boot lifetime, regardless of
//! intervening releases) the pool is exhausted and refuses. Phase 1 is
//! single-node, single boot; this is a deliberate Phase 1 simplification
//! and an operator note in the boot-time `health.startup.ready` event.
//!
//! `BackendIdAllocator` made the same choice (commit `allocator.rs:69`:
//! "Does NOT recycle the counter value — the counter is monotonic and
//! never wraps in practice"). Same shape; different token domain.
