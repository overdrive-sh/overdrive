//! Shared request/response types for the Phase 1 REST API.
//!
//! Per ADR-0014 (§Shared types), the CLI imports these same types
//! directly — they ARE the wire contract. The `OpenAPI` schema derived
//! via `utoipa` (ADR-0009) is a byproduct of these types, not a
//! parallel definition.
//!
//! The shapes pinned here are:
//! - Step 02-03 AC — exact field sets; renaming breaks the contract.
//! - ADR-0008 — endpoint table (`POST /v1/jobs`, `GET /v1/jobs/{id}`,
//!   `GET /v1/cluster/info`, `GET /v1/allocs`, `GET /v1/nodes`).
//! - ADR-0015 — `ErrorBody` shape `{error, message, field}`.
//!
//! `JobSpecInput` is re-used from `overdrive_core::aggregate` so there
//! is exactly one definition of the spec shape on the wire. The CLI
//! will construct `JobSpecInput` from its TOML input; the server will
//! deserialise the same type out of JSON; both route through
//! `Job::from_spec` for validation.

// The `utoipa::OpenApi` derive on `OverdriveApi` below expands to code
// using `.for_each(...)` on the collected schemas. The lint fires on
// the macro expansion rather than any source we wrote, and outer
// `#[allow]` attributes do not propagate into the derive. Scope the
// allow to this module, which contains exactly one `utoipa` derive.
