//! `ViewStore` — runtime-owned storage abstraction for reconciler `View`
//! values per ADR-0035 §2.
//!
//! The `Reconciler` trait surface (after the §18 collapse) does not
//! expose any storage handle. Reconciler authors derive
//! `Serialize + Deserialize + Default + Clone` on the per-reconciler
//! `View` struct and write a sync `reconcile` function over
//! `(desired, actual, view, tick) -> (Vec<Action>, NextView)`. The
//! runtime owns the durable round-trip end-to-end via this port.
//!
//! # Wire shape — bytes on the trait, types in [`ViewStoreExt`]
//!
//! Per ADR-0035 §7 the trait MUST be dyn-compatible so
//! `ReconcilerRuntime::new` can take `Arc<dyn ViewStore>` as its
//! constructor-required port-trait parameter
//! (`.claude/rules/development.md` § "Port-trait dependencies").
//! Generic methods break dyn-compatibility, so the trait operates on
//! pre-encoded CBOR bytes (`Vec<u8>` / `&[u8]`); the typed
//! `bulk_load::<V>` / `write_through::<V>` surface the runtime actually
//! invokes lives on the `Sized`-bounded extension trait
//! [`ViewStoreExt`]. The runtime handles the typed ↔ CBOR translation
//! on either side of the dyn boundary; concrete implementations
//! (`SimViewStore`, `RedbViewStore`) only ever see bytes.
//!
//! # Adapters
//!
//! - **`RedbViewStore`** (step 01-04, `overdrive-control-plane::view_store::redb`):
//!   one redb file per node at `<data_dir>/reconcilers/memory.redb`;
//!   one redb table per reconciler kind keyed on
//!   `TargetResource::display()`; value is a CBOR-encoded blob.
//! - **`SimViewStore`** (step 01-03, `overdrive-sim::adapters::view_store`):
//!   in-memory `BTreeMap<(ReconcilerName, TargetResource), Vec<u8>>`,
//!   with injectable fsync-failure for the
//!   `WriteThroughOrdering` invariant in step 01-07.
//!
//! # Behind `#[allow(dead_code)]` until step 01-05/01-06
//!
//! Step 01-05 (collapsed `Reconciler` trait) and step 01-06 (runtime
//! wiring) close the loop by making `ReconcilerRuntime` take an
//! `Arc<dyn ViewStore>` constructor argument and call `probe()` →
//! `bulk_load()` at register, then `write_through()` after each
//! successful reconcile. Until then this module is dead code by
//! design.
