//! CA issuance + audit binding — every workload SVID issuance writes an
//! `issued_certificates` audit row, bound so an audit-write failure refuses the
//! issuance (built-in-ca / GH #28, ADR-0063 D6).
//!
//! This is the focused issuance seam the workload-start path calls to mint a
//! workload SVID. It composes the [`Ca`] driving port (issue the leaf + draw the
//! issuer serial from the node intermediate) with the [`ObservationStore`]
//! driven port (record the issuance fact as a first-class
//! [`ObservationRow::IssuedCertificate`] row), and **binds the two**: the leaf
//! and its audit row are observable TOGETHER. If the audit row cannot be
//! written, the issuance fails — NO unaudited certificate ever escapes (KPI/AC
//! US-CA-05; ADR-0063 D6 "issuance is never silent").
//!
//! # State-layer hygiene (whitepaper §4, ADR-0063 D2/D6)
//!
//! The CA *material* (root key, intermediate keys) is **intent** (linearizable,
//! the [`crate::ca_boot`] path). The *record of what was issued* — the
//! `issued_certificates` row — is **observation** (gossiped when #36 lands;
//! single-node = local). This module writes ONLY the observation row, through
//! the `ObservationStore` port exactly like `alloc_status` / `node_health`; it
//! never touches the intent store. The `ObservationStore` IS the observation
//! boundary — there is no parallel audit table or inherent-method bypass
//! (ADR-0063 D6 "mirroring AllocStatusRow/NodeHealthRow").
//!
//! # Persist inputs, not derived state
//!
//! Per `.claude/rules/development.md` § "Persist inputs, not derived state",
//! the [`IssuedCertificateRow`] this module builds carries the audit *inputs*
//! observed at issuance time — `serial` / `spiffe_id` (from the faithful
//! [`SvidMaterial`] accessors), `issuer_serial` (from the node
//! [`IntermediateHandle`]), the validity window, `node_id`, and `issued_at`
//! (the [`Clock`] observation). No derived classification is persisted.
//!
//! # Re-issue without restart (US-CA-05 / S-05-05)
//!
//! [`issue_and_audit`] is an on-demand call on the RUNNING control plane —
//! calling it twice for the same [`SpiffeId`] mints a FRESH leaf each time
//! (distinct serial, new validity window) and writes a fresh audit row, with NO
//! restart. This is the mechanism the #40 rotation workflow will later drive on
//! a schedule; this module provides only the mechanism, not the trigger.

// the window the leaf was issued for, so it MUST derive from the same SSOT
// (a local copy reintroduces the drift ADR-0063 D6 exists to prevent).

// The leaf's exact `not_before`/`not_after` are an adapter-internal detail
// ([`SvidMaterial`] exposes no validity accessors per ADR-0063 D1 / research
// Finding 5 — the leaf key never crosses the trait boundary, and neither does
// the window). The audit row therefore *reconstructs* the issuance window from
// the observed `issued_at` plus the shared constants, per "persist inputs, not
// derived state" — the inputs being `issued_at`, `SKEW_TOLERANCE`, and
// `WORKLOAD_SVID_TTL`, all known to the control plane.

///
/// 1. Mint the node intermediate (`ca.issue_intermediate(node)`) to obtain the

///    (Phase 2.6): one node → one intermediate, idempotently cached by the
///    adapter, so this does not re-mint on re-issue.
/// 2. Mint the leaf (`ca.issue_svid(request)`) — a fresh certificate each call
///    (distinct serial, new validity), the re-issue mechanism (S-05-05).
/// 3. Build the [`IssuedCertificateRow`] from the FAITHFUL observed facts —
///    `serial` / `spiffe_id` from [`SvidMaterial`]'s per-call accessors,
///    `issuer_serial` from the [`IntermediateHandle`](overdrive_core::traits::ca::IntermediateHandle),
///    `issued_at` from the injected [`Clock`], and the observed validity window.
/// 4. **Write the audit row through the [`ObservationStore`] port, then hand
///    back the leaf.** The row is written as a first-class
///    [`ObservationRow::IssuedCertificate`] via [`ObservationStore::write`] —
///    the SAME plumbing as `alloc_status` / `node_health` (ADR-0063 D6), so the
///    audit path is DST-testable through `SimObservationStore`. If the write
///    fails, return [`CaIssuanceError::Audit`] and DROP the leaf — no unaudited
///    cert escapes (no silent issuance).
///
/// # Errors
///
/// * [`CaIssuanceError::Ca`] — the leaf or intermediate could not be signed.
/// * [`CaIssuanceError::Audit`] — the leaf was minted but its audit row could
///   not be written; the issuance is refused and the cert dropped.
