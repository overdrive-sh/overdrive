//! `WorkflowEngine` — the durable-async executor for the `Workflow`
//! primitive (ADR-0064 §1, §3, §5).
//!
//! The engine is to workflows what `Driver` is to allocations: the async
//! executor a *pure-sync* reconciler drives **off the action-shim**
//! (ADR-0023's sanctioned async boundary), NOT a reconciler itself. The
//! workflow-lifecycle reconciler (lands 01-06) emits
//! `Action::StartWorkflow`; the action-shim hands the instance to
//! [`WorkflowEngine::start`], which `load_journal`s, builds a
//! [`WorkflowCtx`] carrying a durable [`JournalCursor`] handle, and drives
//! the author's `async fn run` as a tracked `tokio` task. This is the
//! upheld two-primitive doctrine (R3): the reconciler manages WHICH
//! instances should exist; the engine manages HOW each instance's steps
//! execute between start and terminal.
//!
//! # The replay cursor (ADR-0064 §3, the command/notification partition)
//!
//! On (re)start the engine `load_journal`s the instance's flat ordered
//! `Vec<LoadedEntry>` and constructs a [`JournalCursorHandle`], which
//! **partitions it ONCE at construction** (D2 / CA-5) into a positional
//! command walk (`Vec<JournalCommand>`) plus a `SignalKey`-correlated
//! notification lookup (`BTreeMap<SignalKey, JournalNotification>`). The
//! cursor walks the COMMANDS only, advancing by exactly 1 per replayed
//! command; notifications are resolved off the walk by key and never advance
//! the cursor. The retired `*cursor += 2` two-positional-entry signal walk is
//! gone. Each `ctx.run` durable step is check-then-record (the command-index
//! is the identity):
//!
//! - **Replay (command-cursor < command-walk length):** the handle returns
//!   the recorded CBOR result bytes WITHOUT polling the step's future — the
//!   exactly-once guarantee on the replay path (K1). The command-cursor
//!   advances by 1.
//! - **Live (command-cursor == command-walk length):** the handle returns
//!   `Ok(None)`; the ctx polls the step's future, then the handle appends a
//!   [`JournalCommand::RunResult`] (wrapped as a [`LoadedEntry::Command`])
//!   with fsync BEFORE returning (ADR-0063 §4 fsync-then-suspend) and
//!   advances the command-cursor by 1.
//!
//! A `ctx.wait_for_signal` resolves its `SignalSeen` by
//! `signal_notifications.get(signal_key)` — never by position; a
//! `SignalAwaited` command with no matching `SignalSeen` notification
//! re-blocks (the "crashed while blocked" shape, now structural).
//!
//! The engine drives the object-safe [`ErasedWorkflow::run_erased`] over
//! the start intent's opaque `input` bytes (the typed `Workflow` is
//! erased to it by the [`ErasedWorkflowAdapter`] in the registry). It
//! classifies the drive's `Result<Vec<u8>, WorkflowDriveError>` (ADR-0065
//! §3/§4): `Ok(bytes)` → `Completed { output: bytes }`,
//! `Err(WorkflowDriveError::Terminal)` → `Failed { terminal }`, and
//! `Err(WorkflowDriveError::Transient)` → the retry-re-drive channel (a
//! `ctx.run_retryable` step failed transiently — the engine ABSORBS it and
//! re-drives from the journal up to [`WORKFLOW_RETRY_BUDGET`], minting
//! `Failed { BudgetExhausted }` on exhaustion). A transient NEVER reaches the
//! body's `Result<Output, TerminalError>` return type (ADR-0065 §2) — the
//! body's terminal channel is purely terminal. On a real terminal the engine
//! appends a [`JournalCommand::Terminal`] recording the projected
//! [`WorkflowStatus`].
