//! ADR-0053 revision 2026-06-05 (GH #200) — the reply store for the
//! UNCONNECTED-UDP same-host cgroup path. DISTINCT from the XDP
//! `REVERSE_NAT_MAP` (the connected/remote wire path): different hook,
//! different key envelope value semantics. The key reuses the byte
//! layout of `LocalServiceKey` (the SAME 8-byte POD shape) so the
//! userspace `BackendKey {ip, port, proto}` newtype lowers to it with
//! byte-parity (DDD-2).
//!
//! Written **ordered (reverse-first)** by the same
//! `register_local_backend` call that writes `LOCAL_BACKEND_MAP` — two
//! BPF map syscalls, the guarantee is ordering (no observer sees a
//! forward entry without its reverse), not atomicity (DDD-1, F-2).
//!
//! On a miss, recvmsg4 rewrites the source to the sentinel `192.0.2.1`
//! (RFC 5737) and bumps `REVERSE_LOCAL_MISS_COUNTER` — recvmsg4 CANNOT
//! deny (verifier `[1,1]`, research Q1), so the fail-safe is a source
//! rewrite, not a drop (DDD-3).
//!
//! Endianness lockstep per ADR-0041 / architecture.md § 11: userspace
//! writes host-order; the kernel-side program converts at the boundary.
//!
//! # RED scaffold (Slice 01 / S-01-02)
//!
//! The `#[map]` attribute is NOT yet emitted — per the kernel-side RED
//! convention (`crates/overdrive-bpf/src/maps/mod.rs`), the RED signal
//! for a map scaffold is the absence of the `#[map]` attribute on the
//! static. Adding it is part of DELIVER's GREEN pass (Slice 01). The
//! POD key/value structs are real (the userspace handle + the trait
//! contract reference them); the `#[map]` static itself lands GREEN.
