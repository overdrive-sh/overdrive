//! `REVERSE_NAT_MAP` (the connected/remote wire path): different hook,
//! different key envelope value semantics. The key reuses the byte

//! BPF map syscalls, the guarantee is ordering (no observer sees a
//! forward entry without its reverse), not atomicity (DDD-1, F-2).
//!
//! On a miss, recvmsg4 leaves the source byte-for-byte intact (a pure
//! no-op) and bumps `REVERSE_LOCAL_MISS_COUNTER` for observability only
//! (ADR-0053 § D3 rev 2026-06-05b / UI-1). recvmsg4 fires on EVERY
//! unconnected-UDP recv from a cgroup descendant, so a miss means "this
//! datagram is not a service reply at all" — rewriting its source would
//! corrupt unrelated traffic. recvmsg4 CANNOT deny (verifier `[1,1]`,
//! research Q1); the K5 no-leak guarantee is preserved by the reverse-first
//! dual-write's always-hit property, NOT by a miss-path sentinel (DDD-3).
//!
//! Endianness lockstep per ADR-0041 / architecture.md § 11: userspace
//! writes host-order; the kernel-side program converts at the boundary.
